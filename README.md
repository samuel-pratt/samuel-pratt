## Hello 👋

I'm a Software Developer at [Kano](https://www.kanoapps.com/) in Victoria, BC. I'm interested in esoteric languages, polygot programs, and the tools built for them. I also like building things that have localized applications for Vancouver Island and UVic.

## A few things I've built

- [🛳 BC Ferries API](https://github.com/samuel-pratt/bc-ferries-api) - The only public API for retrieving current data on BC Ferries sailings.
- [🐛 Bugsnax API](https://github.com/samuel-pratt/bugsnax-api) - A public, open-source api for the game Bugsnax by Young Horses.
- [🧠 brainfuck-go](https://github.com/samuel-pratt/brainfuck-go) - A [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) interpreter written in Go.
- [◻ whitespace-go](https://github.com/samuel-pratt/whitespace-go) - A [Whitespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_(programming_language)) interpreter written in Go.
